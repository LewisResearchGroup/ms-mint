# Installation instructions

You can install the latest release of **ms-mint** directly from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install ms-mint
```

This will install the core library for use in scripts, notebooks, or other Python-based workflows.

> **Note:** As of version `1.0.0`, ms-mint uses [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) standards via `pyproject.toml` for packaging. If you plan to install from source or contribute, ensure you have an up-to-date version of `pip`, `setuptools`, and `build` installed:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools build
```

To install the latest development version directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/LewisResearchGroup/ms-mint.git
```

For most users, the PyPI version is sufficient and recommended.
