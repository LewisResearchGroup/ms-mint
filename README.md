# Wecome to ms-mint 

## A Python library for targeted metabolomics
The `ms-mint` library can be used for targeted metabolomics and large amounts of files (1000+). Metabolomics is the study of all small chemical compounds (metabolites) in a biological sample. 
The metabolites can define biomarkers, which are used in medicine as indicators of disease or for the development of diagnostic tests. `ms-mint` contains functions to process liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) based metabolomics data in various formats. It uses a target list and the MS-filenames as input to extract peak intensities and other information. 

## Documentation
The code documentation can be accessed [here](https://lewisresearchgroup.github.io/ms-mint/readme.html).

## News
MINT has been split into the Python library and the app. This repository contains the Python library. For the app follow [this link](https://github.com/LewisResearchGroup/ms-mint-app).

## Contributions
All contributions, bug reports, code reviews, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.
Before you modify the code please reach out to us using the [issues](https://github.com/LewisResearchGroup/ms-mint/issues) page.

## Code standards
The project follows PEP8 standard and uses Black and Flake8 to ensure a consistent code format throughout the project.

# Example usage

The main class of mint is can be in ported with `from ms_mint.Mint import Mint`. This command imports a lightweight version with essential functionality. If you aim to use the tool interactively in a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, you can import `from ms_mint.notebook import Mint`. These class is made for Jupyter notebooks and provides more functions.

### ms-mint in JupyterLab, or the Jupyter Notebook
In the JupyterLab you would first instantiate the main class and then load a number of mass-spectrometry (MS) files and a target list.

    %pylab inline
    from ms_mint.notebook import Mint
    mint = Mint()

## Data extraction

### Load files
You can import files simply by assigning a list to the `Mint.ms_files` attribute.

    mint.ms_files = [
        './input/EC_B2.mzXML',
        './input/EC_B1.mzXML',
        './input/CA_B1.mzXML',
        './input/CA_B4.mzXML',
        './input/CA_B2.mzXML',
        './input/CA_B3.mzXML',
        './input/EC_B4.mzXML',
        './input/EC_B3.mzXML',
        './input/SA_B4.mzML',
        './input/SA_B2.mzML',
        './input/SA_B1.mzML',
        './input/SA_B3.mzML'
    ]

Or you can use the `Mint.load_files()` method which supports a string with regular expressions. The files in the previous function you could load with:

    mint.load_files('./input/*.*')

### Load target list

Then you load the target definitions from a file the `load_targets` method is used:    
    
    mint.load_targets('targets.csv')
    
    mint.targets
    >>>    peak_label    mz_mean  mz_width       rt  rt_min  rt_max  intensity_threshold target_filename
        0    Arabitol  151.06050        10  4.92500    4.65    5.20                    0     targets.csv
        1    Xanthine  151.02585        10  4.37265    4.18    4.53                    0     targets.csv
        2   Succinate  117.01905        10  2.04390    0.87    2.50                    0     targets.csv
        3   Urocanate  137.03540        10  4.41500    4.30    4.60                    0     targets.csv
        4  Mevalonate  147.06570        10  3.00000    1.70    4.30                    0     targets.csv
        5  Nicotinate  122.02455        10  3.05340    2.75    3.75                    0     targets.csv
        6  Citrulline  174.08810        10  8.40070    8.35    8.50                    0     targets.csv

You can also prepare a `pandas.DataFrame` with the column names as shown above and assign it directly to the `Mint.targets` attribute:

    mint.targets = my_targets_dataframe

### Run data extraction
When filenames and targets are loaded, the processing can be started by calling the `run()` method:

    mint.run()  # Use mint.run(output_fn='results') for many files to prevent memory issues.

Then the results will be stored in the `results` attribute:
    mint.results
    >>>
    ...

### Processing a large number of files

If you want to process a large number of files, you should provide an output filename. Then the results are written directly to that file instead of being stored in memory. 

    mint.run(fn='my-mint-output.csv')

## Optimize retention times
In case you have only Rt values for your targets, or it turns out that the values are somewhat off, you can use the optimization function `mint.opt.rt_min_max()` for to generate better values for `rt_min` and `rt_max`. In the current example the peaks look like this:

![](notebooks/peak-shapes-before-opt.png)

Now, we can run the peak optimization with:

    mint.opt.rt_min_max(
        fns=[...]
        peak_labels=['Xanthine', 'Succinate', 'Citrulline'],
        plot=True, rel_height=0.7, sigma=50, col_wrap=1, aspect=3,
        height=4
    )

If you do not provide a list for `peak_labels` the optimization will run for all metabolites. If no list with filenames is provided for `fn` all currently loaded files `mint.ms_files` are used. We usually use 20-40 files at maximum. If you run a set of standards with your samples (highly recommended) you can use the standard files to run the optimization. After optimization you should consider a manual fine tuning especially for complicated peaks (two or more peaks, noisy peaks, etc.). You can look at the peak shapes after you ran the main routine (`Mint.run()`) with the plotting tools (`Mint.plot.peak_shapes()`), explained further below.
    
![](notebooks/opt-rt.png)

The black lines indicates the average intensity across all files used for the optimization. The orange dotted lines show the shape of the gaussian function used to weight the mean intensities for peak selection. The orange horizontal lines indicate the peak width and the blue `x`s show the identified peak maxima. The green shaded areas show the Rt ranges which were selected by the algorithm.

Then we apply the changes and plot the new peak shapes:

    mint.run()
    mint.plot.peak_shapes(col_wrap=3)

![](notebooks/peak-shapes-after-opt.png)

As you can see, the shapes of Xanthine, Succinate, Citrulline look much better.


## Plotting and data exploration

The `Mint` class has a few convenient methods to visualize and explore the processed data. The results can be viewed directly in JupyterLab or stored to files using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` syntax. The figures are matplotlib objects and can be easily customised. 

## Plot peak shapes

![](notebooks/peak-shapes-after-opt.png)

    mint.plot.peak_shapes(col_wrap = 3)

The method uses seaborn [sns.relplot()](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.relplot.html) function and keyword arguments are passed on.

# FAQ
## What is a target list
A target list is a pandas dataframe with specific columns. 

-   **peak_label**: string, Label of the peak (must be unique).
-   **mz_mean**: numeric value, theoretical m/z value of the target ion to extract.
-   **mz_width**: numeric value, width of the peak in \[ppm\]. It is used to calculate the width of the mass window  according to the formula: `Î”m = m/z * 1e-6 * mz_width`.
-   **rt**: numeric value, (optional), expected time of the peak. This value is not used during processing, but it can inform the peak optimization procedure.
-   **rt_min**: numeric value, starting time for peak integration.
-   **rt_max**: numeric value, ending time for peak integration.
-   **rt_unit**: one of `s` or `min` for seconds or minutes respectively.
-   **intensity_threshold**: numeric value (>=0), minimum intensity value to include, serves as a noise filter. We recommend setting this to 0. 
-   **target_filename**: string (optional), name of the target list file. It is not used for processing, just to keep track of what files were used.

The target list can be stored as csv or Excel file. 

## What input files can be used
`ms_mint` can be used with `mzXML`, `mzML`, `mzMLb` and experimental formats in `.feather` and `.parquet` format.
