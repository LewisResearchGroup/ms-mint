# MINT (Metabolomics Integrator)

![GUI](./docs/image/mint-overview.png "The GUI")

MINT is an app for processing mzML and mzXML mass-spectrometry (MS) files in MS1 mode. Its main function is to sum up intensity values from usually pre-defined windows in m/z and scan-time (also called retention time) space. These windows can be provided in a `csv-file` or set programmatically. Therefore, a large number of MS-files can be processed in very standardized and reproducible manner.

The tool can be used with a browser based graphical user interface (GUI) implemented as interactive dashboard with [Plotly-Dash](https://plot.ly/dash/). A second (experimental) GUI is available that runs integrated in a `Jupyter Notebook`. Alternatively, the `ms_mint` package can be imported as python library to be integrated in any Python script and processing pipeline to automate MS-file processing.

More information on how to install and run the program can be found in the [Documentation](https://soerendip.github.io/ms-mint/).
