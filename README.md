# Wecome to ms-mint 

## A Python library for targeted metabolomics
The `ms-mint` library is a tool designed to assist with targeted metabolomics studies, which involves the systematic analysis of small chemical compounds called metabolites that are present in biological samples. These metabolites can provide valuable information about the state of an organism, including indicators of disease or other physiological changes. In order to perform a targeted metabolomics study, researchers typically use liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) to identify and quantify specific metabolites of interest.

The `ms-mint` library includes a range of functions for processing LCMS data from targeted metabolomics experiments, and it is particularly well-suited for handling large amounts of data (10,000+ files). To use `ms-mint`, you provide it with a target list of the specific metabolites you want to analyze, as well as the names of the mass spectrometry files containing the data. ms-mint then extracts peak intensities and other relevant information from the data, allowing you to gain insights into the concentrations and profiles of the metabolites in your samples. This information can be used to identify biomarkers, which are indicators of disease or other physiological changes that can be used in the development of diagnostic tests or other medical applications.

# Usage

To use the main class of the ms-mint library, you can import it into your code with the following command:

    from ms_mint.Mint import Mint

This will import a lightweight version of the class with the essential functionality. If you want to use the ms-mint tool interactively in a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, you can import the class with the following command:

    from ms_mint.notebook import Mint

This version of the class is designed specifically for use in Jupyter notebooks and includes additional functions. Once you have imported the appropriate version of the class, you can create an instance of the Mint class and use its methods to process your data.

### ms-mint in JupyterLab, or the Jupyter Notebook
In the JupyterLab you would first instantiate the main class and then load a number of mass-spectrometry (MS) files and a target list.

    %pylab inline
    from ms_mint.notebook import Mint
    mint = Mint()

## Data extraction

### Load files
You can import files simply by assigning a list to the `Mint.ms_files` attribute.

    mint.ms_files = [
        './input/EC_B2.mzXML',
        './input/EC_B1.mzXML',
        './input/CA_B1.mzXML',
        './input/CA_B4.mzXML',
        './input/CA_B2.mzXML',
        './input/CA_B3.mzXML',
        './input/EC_B4.mzXML',
        './input/EC_B3.mzXML',
        './input/SA_B4.mzML',
        './input/SA_B2.mzML',
        './input/SA_B1.mzML',
        './input/SA_B3.mzML'
    ]

Or you can use the `Mint.load_files()` method which supports a string with regular expressions. The files in the previous function you could load with:

    mint.load_files('./input/*.*')

### Load target list

Then you load the target definitions from a file the `load_targets` method is used:    
    
    mint.load_targets('targets.csv')
    
    mint.targets
    >>>    peak_label    mz_mean  mz_width       rt  rt_min  rt_max  intensity_threshold target_filename
        0    Arabitol  151.06050        10  4.92500    4.65    5.20                    0     targets.csv
        1    Xanthine  151.02585        10  4.37265    4.18    4.53                    0     targets.csv
        2   Succinate  117.01905        10  2.04390    0.87    2.50                    0     targets.csv
        3   Urocanate  137.03540        10  4.41500    4.30    4.60                    0     targets.csv
        4  Mevalonate  147.06570        10  3.00000    1.70    4.30                    0     targets.csv
        5  Nicotinate  122.02455        10  3.05340    2.75    3.75                    0     targets.csv
        6  Citrulline  174.08810        10  8.40070    8.35    8.50                    0     targets.csv

You can also prepare a `pandas.DataFrame` with the column names as shown above and assign it directly to the `Mint.targets` attribute:

    mint.targets = my_targets_dataframe

### Run data extraction
When filenames and targets are loaded, the processing can be started by calling the `run()` method:

    mint.run()  # Use mint.run(output_fn='results') for many files to prevent memory issues.

Then the results will be stored in the `results` attribute:
    mint.results
    >>>
    ...

### Processing a large number of files

If you want to process a large number of files, you should provide an output filename. Then the results are written directly to that file instead of being stored in memory. 

    mint.run(fn='my-mint-output.csv')

## Optimize retention times

If you only have retention time (Rt) values for your targets, or if the Rt values you have are not accurate, you can use the `mint.opt.rt_min_max()` function from the ms-mint library to generate better values for the `rt_min` and `rt_max` parameters. These parameters define the range of retention times within which `ms-mint` will search for peaks corresponding to your targets. By optimizing these values, you can improve the accuracy and reliability of your results.

To use the `mint.opt.rt_min_max()` function, you will need to provide it with a list of retention times for your targets and the names of the mass spectrometry files containing your data. The function will then search through the data to find the optimal `rt_min` and `rt_max` values, which you can use to refine your analysis. You can then use these optimized values in conjunction with the other functions and methods of the `Mint` class to process and analyze your data.

![](notebooks/peak-shapes-before-opt.png)

Now we can run the peak optimization with:

    mint.opt.rt_min_max(
        fns=[...]
        peak_labels=['Xanthine', 'Succinate', 'Citrulline'],
        plot=True, rel_height=0.7, sigma=50, col_wrap=1, aspect=3,
        height=4
    )

The `mint.opt.rt_min_max()` function in the ms-mint library allows you to optimize the `rt_min` and `rt_max` values for your analysis. These values define the range of retention times within which ms-mint will search for peaks corresponding to your targets. By optimizing these values, you can improve the accuracy and reliability of your results.

If you do not provide a list of peak_labels to the `mint.opt.rt_min_max()` function, it will run the optimization for all metabolites. Similarly, if you do not provide a list of filenames for the fn parameter, the function will use all of the files currently loaded into mint.ms_files. It is generally recommended to use a maximum of 20-40 files for the optimization process. If you have run a set of standards along with your samples (which is highly recommended), you can use the standard files to perform the optimization.

After running the optimization, it is a good idea to perform a manual fine-tuning of the `rt_min` and `rt_max` values, especially for complicated peaks (peaks with multiple components, noisy peaks, etc.). You can use the `mint.plot.peak_shapes()` function to visualize the peak shapes and identify any areas that may require further attention.
    
![](notebooks/opt-rt.png)

    mint.run()

    mint.plot.peak_shapes(col_wrap=3)

![](notebooks/peak-shapes-after-opt.png)

As you can see the shapes of Xanthine, Succinate, Citrulline look much better.

## Plotting and data exploration

The `Mint` class has a few convenient methods to visualize and explore the processed data. The results can be viewed directly in JupyterLab or stored to files using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` syntax. The figures are matplotlib objects and can be easily customised. 

## Plot peak shapes

# FAQ
## What is a target list
A target list is a pandas dataframe with specific columns. 

-   **peak_label**: string, Label of the peak (must be unique).
-   **mz_mean**: numeric value, theoretical m/z value of the target ion to extract.
-   **mz_width**: numeric value, width of the peak in \[ppm\]. It is used to calculate the width of the mass window  according to the formula: `Î”m = m/z * 1e-6 * mz_width`.
-   **rt**: numeric value, (optional), expected time of the peak. This value is not used during processing, but it can inform the peak optimization procedure.
-   **rt_min**: numeric value, starting time for peak integration.
-   **rt_max**: numeric value, ending time for peak integration.
-   **rt_unit**: one of `s` or `min` for seconds or minutes respectively.
-   **intensity_threshold**: numeric value (>=0), minimum intensity value to include, serves as a noise filter. We recommend setting this to 0. 
-   **target_filename**: string (optional), name of the target list file. It is not used for processing, just to keep track of what files were used.

The target list can be stored as csv or Excel file. 

## What input files can be used
`ms_mint` can be used with `mzXML`, `mzML`, `mzMLb` and experimental formats in `.feather` and `.parquet` format.
